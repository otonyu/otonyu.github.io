        When dealing with HTML and CSS there are a few factors to consider with the actual content in you page. There are 3 parameters to consider that are directly related to your content's surroundings. Margin, border, and padding surround your content and can all be manipulated through CSS. Content is immediately surrounded by padding. Padding is essentially the distance from the content "block" (I used the word block, but your content can be pretty much any shape) to the border. After the border comes the margin which is the distance all around the border from other elements in your HTML. Here's a visualization of how these pieces fit together.

        Typically, if you figure out how you want your content pieces to look you can work with padding,  border, and margin in conjunction with positioning to get your content in the exact places you want. If you're just beginning it can take a while to understand exactly how padding, border, and margin interconnect, but after getting it down it manipulating these three elements becomes a powerful weapon in your CSS arsenal.
