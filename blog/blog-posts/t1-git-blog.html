        I guess I'll git talking about the tricky git that is known as Git (and Github!). Actually, Git is not bad at all. You just have to learn to speak its language*! Git is an indispensable tool (there are alternatives like subversion) and Github is... well, a hub for git if that wasn't obvious!

      <p id="Content">
        So, what are the main benefits of using git/Github?
        <ul>
          <li>Version Control</li>
          <li> Centralized location</li>
        </ul>

        Version control is essential to the process of software development. It allows you to return to a previous iteration of your software in case something goes crazy when rolling out changes to your live site. Git tracks also tracks and changes made (added/deleted/relocated/etc) and keeps a record every time you commit (save). Github is great for storing your code, because the parties working on any particular project don't have to be in the same room or building or location in order to collaborate. You can contribute from anywhere across the globe that you have Internet access! This means, for open source things anyone can try to contribute (you can obviously keep your project private) which brings in different perspectives and allows for a more rounded end-result. All-in-all git is pretty great!

      *My first encounter was basically me speaking French while Git was speaking what might as well have been Taiwanese - I don't know how to speak French by the way.
