          After watching <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a>, I think I gained a clarification of what DBC is and a greater appreciation for what they're doing. For me, DBC essentially boils down to passionate people, instructors and students, coming together to work towards a common goal: creating world class beginners! I think I will fit into DBC culture pretty seamlessly for a few reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>
                I'm not afraid to be a "chef". DBC seems like it is what you make of it, and want to make an amazing dish!
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm willing to delve as deep as I can into the program and get everything I can out of it, without stepping on anyone's toes of course.
              </li>
              <li>
                Honestly, so far this process has been really exciting. Challenging, but exciting. I can't get enough. Going to bed late, waking up early (within reason :)).   It's been exhilarating since day 1!
              </li>
            </ul>
            I can't wait to see what else is in store!
